Background
==============

Cassius is the client component for a experimental flipboard like social reader I'm working on. It currently parses a custom JSON feed of tweets and lay out the content as pages of article blocks.

The image used as the book cover is grabbed from Instagrams' API of currently trending images.

For the server side component please check out Camus at https://github.com/kenshin03/camus.

Please note that everything is as rough and poorly written as it could be. 


Third party libraries:

   * AFKPageFlipper - The awesome and super smooth page flipping effects were taken from https://github.com/mtabini/AFKPageFlipper. Kudos to Marcos for the wonderful library.
   * CoreGraphics, QuartzCore, JSON.h
